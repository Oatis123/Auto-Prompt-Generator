# Auto-Prompt-Generator

This project implements an autonomous prompt generation system. It leverages an AI 'teacher' agent (currently powered by `deepseek_r1`, though this is not a final choice and can be configured) to create and refine prompts, potentially by testing them against a 'student' AI (currently powered by `gemini25_flash`, also configurable). The system aims to automate the process of generating effective prompts for various AI models based on a given request.
